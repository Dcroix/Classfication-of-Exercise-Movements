# Classification-of-Exercise-Movements
This project on practical machine learning works on a data set about the exercise movements of mobile users. In this project we will explore the data set, train machine learning models (using Classification Trees, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest), assess its respective accuracy in classifying these exercise movements using the validation set, and predict classifications made by the better performing model using the test set. Check it out using this [link](https://dcroix.github.io/Classification-of-Exercise-Movements/PML-Project.html).
